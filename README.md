# The Guitar Index

The Guitar Index is a static HTML website that serves as a claim hub and landing page for publishing articles about historic guitars, collections, provenance, and the guitar market. Built as a simple, fast-loading site for brand building and content publishing, it focuses on how lore, documentation, and market events create and preserve value in the guitar world. This repository contains the static HTML files that will be hosted on GitHub Pages.
